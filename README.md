# Local development requirements `SETUP`

### This UI app was developed on a windows machine ( not tested on IOS development platform)
#### - For local development you will need to download the following dependencies
##### 1- nodejs ( which will download npm by default as well)
##### 2- any IDE ( our team chose webstorm )
##### 3- GitHub bash tools ( terminal & command interactions )

Once you clone the project from the main repository and open it with your IDE - make sure to execute `npm install` in order for the application to pull all dependencies associated
